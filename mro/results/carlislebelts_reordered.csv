The specially compounded wrapped construction is ideal for clutching operations. Banded v-belts are ideally suited for pulsating or heavily shock loaded drives and drives with extremely long center distances.

The specially compounded wrapped construction is ideal for clutching operations. Banded v-belts are ideally suited for pulsating or heavily shock loaded drives and drives with extremely long center distances.

The Metric Power-Wedge Cog-Belt combines the advantages of the narrow wedge design with raw edge performance for maximum operating efficiency in a compact drive package. The narrow profile permits reduced drive widths and a smaller drive envelope. Higher horsepower ratings translate into greater design flexibility — reducing drive cost, space and weight.</p><p>The Power-Wedge Cog-Belt is now made of EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer), a synthetic rubber with outstanding properties.
