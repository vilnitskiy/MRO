The Metric Power-Wedge Cog-Belt combines the advantages of the narrow wedge design with raw edge performance for maximum operating efficiency in a compact drive package. The narrow profile permits reduced drive widths and a smaller drive envelope. Higher horsepower ratings translate into greater design flexibility — reducing drive cost, space and weight.</p><p>The Power-Wedge Cog-Belt is now made of EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer), a synthetic rubber with outstanding properties. The raw-edge construction contributes to outstanding operating efficiency. More torque with little or no slippage.

Less Slip</em>. The Metric Power-Wedge Cog-Belt combines the advantages of the narrow wedge design with raw edge performance for maximum operating efficiency in a compact drive package. The narrow profile permits reduced drive widths and a smaller drive envelope. Higher horsepower ratings translate into greater design flexibility — reducing drive cost, space and weight.</p><p>The Power-Wedge Cog-Belt is now made of EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer), a synthetic rubber with outstanding properties. The raw-edge construction contributes to outstanding operating efficiency. More torque with little or no slippage.

Less Slip</em>. The Metric Power-Wedge Cog-Belt combines the advantages of the narrow wedge design with raw edge performance for maximum operating efficiency in a compact drive package. The narrow profile permits reduced drive widths and a smaller drive envelope. Higher horsepower ratings translate into greater design flexibility — reducing drive cost, space and weight.</p><p>The Power-Wedge Cog-Belt is now made of EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer), a synthetic rubber with outstanding properties. The raw-edge construction contributes to outstanding operating efficiency. More torque with little or no slippage.

Less Slip</em>. The Metric Power-Wedge Cog-Belt combines the advantages of the narrow wedge design with raw edge performance for maximum operating efficiency in a compact drive package. The narrow profile permits reduced drive widths and a smaller drive envelope. Higher horsepower ratings translate into greater design flexibility — reducing drive cost, space and weight.</p><p>The Power-Wedge Cog-Belt is now made of EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer), a synthetic rubber with outstanding properties.

Less Slip</em>. The Metric Power-Wedge Cog-Belt combines the advantages of the narrow wedge design with raw edge performance for maximum operating efficiency in a compact drive package. The narrow profile permits reduced drive widths and a smaller drive envelope. Higher horsepower ratings translate into greater design flexibility — reducing drive cost, space and weight.</p><p>The Power-Wedge Cog-Belt is now made of EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer), a synthetic rubber with outstanding properties.

Less Slip</em>. The Metric Power-Wedge Cog-Belt combines the advantages of the narrow wedge design with raw edge performance for maximum operating efficiency in a compact drive package. The narrow profile permits reduced drive widths and a smaller drive envelope. Higher horsepower ratings translate into greater design flexibility — reducing drive cost, space and weight.</p><p>The Power-Wedge Cog-Belt is now made of EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer), a synthetic rubber with outstanding properties.

Less Slip</em>. The Metric Power-Wedge Cog-Belt combines the advantages of the narrow wedge design with raw edge performance for maximum operating efficiency in a compact drive package. The narrow profile permits reduced drive widths and a smaller drive envelope. Higher horsepower ratings translate into greater design flexibility — reducing drive cost, space and weight.</p><p>The Power-Wedge Cog-Belt is now made of EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer), a synthetic rubber with outstanding properties. The raw-edge construction contributes to outstanding operating efficiency. More torque with little or no slippage.

The cord is coated with a special compound that produces a secure, long-lasting bond with the surrounding rubber. The heavy-duty fabric cover protects the core. Its extra flexibility permits the belt to bend more easily around the smallest pulleys with less strain on the fabric. Longer belt life results in less frequent replacement, less downtime and lower maintenance costs.</p><p><strong>Features/Advantages</strong></p><ul><li>Dependable performance on classical belt drives</li><li>Heavy duty cover is impregnated with oil and heat resistant rubber</li><li>Resists flex fatigue</li><li>Longer belt life</li><li>Smoother running</li><li>Backed by our Iron Clad Guarantee</a></li><li>Built to Chek Mate belt tolerances for a matched set</li></ul><p><strong>Applications</strong></p><ul><li>Mixers, pumps, conveyors, any and everything, and more</li></ul><p><strong>Sizes</strong></p><ul><li>AP, BP, CP, DP, EP cross-sections from 22"" to 664""<br><br></li></ul></div>",http://www.carlislebelts.com/cms_files/original/11001_Carlisle_Belts_LineCard_Brochure_USA_06151711.pdf,Carlisle DP315MS Super Blue Ribbon V-Belt
