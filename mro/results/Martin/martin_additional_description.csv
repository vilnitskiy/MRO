The round shape allows you to quickly turn the screwdriver by supporting the shank with one hand while turning the handle with the other. Typically, use a parallel sided tip (Cabinetmaker’s or Electrician’s) configuration for slotted flat head screws, and a standard slotted flared or winged tip (Mechanic’s Blade) for slotted round or oval head screws. Use Phillips tip only for Phillips head screws. Always match the appropriate screwdriver tip to the specific size and type of screw.

                    Crowfoot Socket Wrench Attachments are drop forged from steel bar. These wrenches are available in drive sizes of 3/8” and ½”, in 12 point Flare-Nut openings in fractional sizes. They come in Chrome and Industrial Black finish. These are special purpose attachment heads designed to accept either a socket wrench handle or extension piece, for use in tightening or loosening nuts which are in odd positions. The 12 point Flare nut design provides extreme flexibility in addressing these situations. The extra head thickness provides maximum surface contact area and helps prevent marring of fittings.
