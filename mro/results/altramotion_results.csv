Manufactured from acetal, nylon, and hardened and unhardened steel, they offer the smoothest, quietest form of gearing when properly applied.  Because the efficiency of a worm gear drive depends on the lead angle and number of starts on the worm, it important to keep the ratio as low as possible.

It is manufactured using the powdered metal process with the purest metal powders. This process ensures the uniform distribution of pores between the bronze particles which absorb the oil by capillary action. In addition, Bost-Bronz has a self-contained oil supply (approximately 20% by volume) which provides a uniform protective film over the entire bearing surface. As a result, Bost-Bronz bearings are one of the most effective bearings available for precision performance.  Bost-Bronz bearings are also highly versatile and can be used for production and replacement requirements throughout general industry. They have proven to be efficient under heavy loads at moderate speeds, as well as under light loads at high speeds. In addition, they are ideally suited for applications where normal lubrication is difficult or impossible to provide.</p><br><table><tr><th>Product Family</th><th>Bost-Bronz</th></tr><tr><th>Weight</th><th>0.002</th></tr><tr><th>Product Description</th><th>Bearing, Thrust Type, Oil Impregnated, Sintered Bronze</th></tr><tr><th>Altra Master No.</th><th>30217632</th></tr><tr><th>Inside Diameter</th><th>0.0811811</th></tr><tr><th>UPC</th><th>781711135570</th></tr><tr><th>Max PV Value</th><th>10,000</th></tr><tr><th>Family Id</th><th>30,070</th></tr><tr><th>Length</th><th>0.125000</th></tr><tr><th>Outside Diameter</th><th>4.000</th></tr><tr><th>Max P Value</th><th>2,000</th></tr><tr><th>Type</th><th>Thrust</th></tr><tr><th>Max V Value (fpm)</th><th>1,200</th></tr><tr><th>Unit Of Measure</th><th>English</th></tr></table>","Altra Master No.:30217632|UPC:781711135570|Type:Thrust|Inside Diameter:2.062500|Inside Diameter:0.0811811|Outside Diameter:4.0000|Outside Diameter:4.000|Product Family:Bost-Bronz|Length:0.125000|Max PV Value:10,000|Max P Value:2,000|Max V Value (fpm):1,200|Product Description:Bearing, Thrust Type, Oil Impregnated, Sintered Bronze|Weight:0.002",TB3364
