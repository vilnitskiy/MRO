Also ideal for conveying applications designed for D/32 section belts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PowerTwist Plus can't be outperformed!</strong> PowerTwist Plus sets the standard for link V-belt longevity and durability. Other brands don't come close. The combination of high strength and low elongation under load simply cannot be beaten. Because they're made of a custom-designed, high-tech polyurethane/polyester composite, PowerTwist Plus V-belts won't fail you when others may. The result? Less downtime. Higher productivity. Reduced maintenance costs.</p>\n\n<p>• Everyday industrial workhorse<br>\n• Minimized maintenance time<br>\n• High performance polyester/polyurethane composite technology with the same horsepower ratings as conventional rubber V-belts<br>\n• Easy to inventory<br>\n• Offer problem solving alternatives to V-belts of classical cross-sections<br>\n• Drop-in permanent upgrade for conventional endless rubber V-belts</p>\n\n<p><strong>The right belt at the right time!</strong> Instead of trying to carry all the endless V-belt sizes you might need, with PowerTwist Plus, you only need to stock the most common cross sections - 3L, 4L/A, 5L/B, C and D - and you'll have almost 100%, on-site availability guaranteed. With PowerTwist Plus you will reduce the inventory dollars you have tied up in replacement V-belts and still have instant availability.</p>\n\n<p>• Perfectly suited to Z/10, 3L, A/13, B/17, C/22, and D/32 drives<br>\n• Reduced inventory… any belt, any time!</p>\n\n<p><strong>No tools required.</strong> No matter what equipment you are operating, productivity is critical. PowerTwist Plus V-Belts minimize downtime with no tools required, easy installation in minutes without machine tear-downs or struggling with rusted-down motor bases.</p>\n\n<p>PowerTwist Plus V-Belts have the same cross section dimensions as conventional endless V-belts and can be installed on existing pulleys with no changes in set-up.</p>\n\n<p>Single or matched V-belt sets can be made with a flick of the wrist! PowerTwist Plus V-Belts can be made up to required length by hand in seconds and rolled onto the drive just like a bicycle chain. Their custom multi-ply composite construction prevents roll-on damage. If conventional rubber V-belts are installed this way, almost certainly some of the load-bearing tension cords will be broken, leading to significantly reduced belt life.</p>\n\n<p>• Easier, faster installation<br>\n• Easily installed without dismantling drive components<br>\n• Make any length by hand in seconds without any tools<br>\n• Simplified drive design</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tame hostile environments</strong> If your V-belt drives are operating in hostile, nasty environments, you've got to take advantage of the high performance properties of polyurethanes. That's why we use a high performance polyurethane elastomer reinforced with multiple plies of polyester fabric for PowerTwist Plus. This custom material provides PowerTwist Plus with significantly superior resistance to oils, grease, water, most common industrial/agricultural chemicals and solvents. Plus an operating temperature range, with no loss of performance, of -40º F to +240º F. Conventional SBR/chloroprene brand V-belts simply can't compete.</p>\n\n<p>If your drive environment is like hell's kitchen and conventional V-belt life is down to a few months, PowerTwist Plus may be your long term answer.</p>\n\n<p>• Longer belt life in harsh operating conditions<br>\n• Unaffected by extreme temperatures, water, steam, oil, grease, and common industrial chemicals and solvents</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reduce transmitted vibration.</strong> All conventional V-belts with a continuous tensile cord will transmit vibrations from the motor to driven components; these vibrations cause system noise and can significantly shorten bearing life.

The pilot bushings are supplied in sets of three (3) bushings and three (3) longer screws (replace plated locking screws).<br><br><strong>Features of Fenner Drives Keyless Bushings:</strong><br><br>• Ability to transmit higher torques<br>• True zero-backlash<br>• Less equipment downtime<br>• Ability to mount over existing keyways<br>• Complete axial and radial adjustability<br>• Simple installation, adjustment and removal<br><br>All Fenner Drives keyless locking devices operate using the simple wedge principle. An axial force is applied- by either a hex nut (Trantorque) or a series of annular screws (B-LOC)- to engage circular steel rings with mating tapers. The resulting wedge action creates a radial force on the tapered rings, one of which contracts to squeeze the shaft while the other expands and presses into the component bore.</p>\n            \n		</div><h5>Specifications</h5><div>\n	\n			\n				\n				<table class=""description-table"">\n					\n							<tr>\n								<th>Series:</th><td>\n								 B400\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Torque Transmission:</th><td>\n								 7603\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Axial Movement:</th><td>\n								 No\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Bore Tolerance:</th><td>\n								 5.309\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Component Bore Diameter:</th><td>\n								 5.305""\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Hub Pressure:</th><td>\n								 25748\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Installation Torque:</th><td>\n								 51 ft lb\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Internal/ External:</th><td>\n								 Internal\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Material:</th><td>\n								 Steel\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Metric/Inch:</th><td>\n								 Inch\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Releasing/ Locking:</th><td>\n								 Releasing\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Screw Size:</th><td>\n								 M10 x 25\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Self-Centering:</th><td>\n								 No\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Shaft Diameter:</th><td>\n								 3  3/4""\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Shaft Tolerance:</th><td>\n								 0.746\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Taper:</th><td>\n								 Double\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Thrust:</th><td>\n								 48656\n							</td></tr>\n						\n				</table>\n			\n		\n</div>"

While the standard allows the resistance of the drive belt to be as high as 3.6 mega ohms (3,600,000 ohms), PowerTwist Plus Antistatic typically registers well below 50 ohms, while even the best so called antistatic (static conductive) rubber belts usually measure between a shocking 10,000-200,000 ohms. Unlike antistatic rubber V-belts whose antistatic properties may be adversely affected by humidity levels, environmental conditions and wear, PowerTwist Plus Antistatic’s proprietary construction allows the belt’s antistatic properties to perform in the harshest conditions. PowerTwist Plus Antistatic is a drop-in replacement for classical section V-belts.</p>\n\n<p>• 100% ISO 1813:1998 inspected and certified by Fenner Drives<br>\n• Ultralow resistance antistatic V-belt<br>\n• Antistatic properties unaffected by humidity levels<br>\n• Electric Blue color for easy identification<br>\n• US Patents 7,621,114 and 7,950,213</p>\n\n<p><strong>PowerTwist Plus Antistatic can't be outperformed!</strong> PowerTwist Plus Antistatic sets the standard for link V-belt longevity and durability.

ISO 1813:1998 certified</p><div>\n			\n                <p><strong>Best Suited For:</strong> Any power transmission application designed to use a classical A/13/4L section antistatic rubber V-belt, such as fuel transfer pumps. Also ideal for conveying applications that frequently have issues with static electricity, such as glass and solar cell manufacturing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Have an application where static electricity is getting you all charged up?</strong> Fenner Drives’ patented PowerTwist Plus Antistatic is the answer… with all the benefits of standard PowerTwist Plus along with the best antistatic properties of any V-belt on the market, easily passing the ISO 1813:1998 standard. While the standard allows the resistance of the drive belt to be as high as 3.6 mega ohms (3,600,000 ohms), PowerTwist Plus Antistatic typically registers well below 50 ohms, while even the best so called antistatic (static conductive) rubber belts usually measure between a shocking 10,000-200,000 ohms. Unlike antistatic rubber V-belts whose antistatic properties may be adversely affected by humidity levels, environmental conditions and wear, PowerTwist Plus Antistatic’s proprietary construction allows the belt’s antistatic properties to perform in the harshest conditions. PowerTwist Plus Antistatic is a drop-in replacement for classical section V-belts.</p>\n\n<p>• 100% ISO 1813:1998 inspected and certified by Fenner Drives<br>\n• Ultralow resistance antistatic V-belt<br>\n• Antistatic properties unaffected by humidity levels<br>\n• Electric Blue color for easy identification<br>\n• US Patents 7,621,114 and 7,950,213</p>\n\n<p><strong>PowerTwist Plus Antistatic can't be outperformed!</strong> PowerTwist Plus Antistatic sets the standard for link V-belt longevity and durability. Other brands don't come close. The combination of high strength and low elongation under load simply cannot be beaten. Because they're made of a custom-designed, high-tech polyurethane/polyester composite, PowerTwist Plus Antistatic V-belts won't fail you when others may. The result? Less downtime. Higher productivity. Reduced maintenance costs.</p>\n\n<p>• Antistatic industrial workhorse<br>\n• Minimized maintenance time<br>\n• High performance polyester/polyurethane composite technology with the same horsepower ratings as conventional rubber V-belts<br>\n• Easy to inventory<br>\n• Offer problem solving alternatives to V-belts of classical cross-sections<br>\n• Drop-in permanent upgrade for conventional endless rubber V-belts</p>\n\n<p><strong>The right belt at the right time!</strong> Instead of trying to carry all the endless V-belt sizes you might need, with PowerTwist Plus Antistatic, you only need to stock the most common cross sections - A/13/4L and B/17/5L and you'll have almost 100%, on-site availability guaranteed. With PowerTwist Plus Antistatic you will reduce the inventory dollars that you have tied up in replacement V-belts and still have instant availability.</p>\n\n<p>• Perfectly suited to A/13/4L, and B/17/5L drives<br>\n• Reduced inventory… any belt, any time!</p>\n\n<p><strong>No tools required.</strong> No matter what equipment you are operating, productivity is critical. PowerTwist Plus Antistatic V-Belts minimize downtime with no tools required and has easy installation in minutes without machine tear-downs or struggling with rusted-down motor bases.</p>\n\n<p>PowerTwist Plus Antistatic V-Belts have the same cross section dimensions as conventional endless V-belts and can be installed on existing pulleys with no changes in set-up.</p>\n\n<p>Single or matched V-belt sets can be made with a flick of the wrist! PowerTwist Plus Antistatic V-Belts can be made up to required length by hand in seconds and rolled onto the drive just like a bicycle chain. Their custom multi-ply composite construction prevents roll-on damage. If conventional rubber V-belts are installed this way, almost certainly some of the load-bearing tension cords will be broken, leading to significantly reduced belt life.</p>\n\n<p>• Easier, faster installation<br>\n• Easily installed without dismantling drive components<br>\n• Make any length by hand in seconds without any tools<br>\n• Simplified drive design</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tame hostile environments</strong> If your V-belt drives are operating in hostile, nasty environments, you've got to take advantage of the high performance properties of polyurethanes. That's why we use a high performance polyurethane elastomer reinforced with multiple plies of polyester fabric for PowerTwist Plus Antistatic. This custom material provides PowerTwist Plus Antistatic with significantly superior resistance to oils, grease, water, and the most common industrial/agricultural chemicals and solvents. Plus an operating temperature range, with no loss of performance, of -40º F to +240º F. Conventional SBR/chloroprene brand V-belts simply can't compete.</p>\n\n<p>If your drive environment is like hell's kitchen and conventional V-belt life is down to a few months, PowerTwist Plus Antistatic may be your long term answer.</p>\n\n<p>• Longer belt life in harsh operating conditions<br>\n• Unaffected by extreme temperatures, water, steam, oil, grease, and common industrial chemicals and solvents</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reduce transmitted vibration.</strong> All conventional V-belts with a continuous tensile cord will transmit vibrations from the motor to driveN components; these vibrations cause system noise and can significantly shorten bearing life. The segmented twist-lock design of PowerTwist Plus Antistatic acts as a vibration dampener - vibration can enter a link but cannot be transmitted as there is no continuous tension cord present. Save your bearings - fit PowerTwist Plus Antistatic V-belts!</p>\n\n<p>• unique belt construction dampens transmitted motor vibrations, extending the bearing life and reducing noise levels<br>\n• high resistance to abrasion and shock loads</p>\n\n<p><strong>RoHS 2002/95/EC Directive compliant.</strong></p>\n\n            \n		</div><h5>Specifications</h5><div>\n	\n			\n				\n				<table class=""description-table"">\n					\n							<tr>\n								<th>Profile shape:</th><td>\n								 Vee\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Profile size:</th><td>\n								 A/13/4L\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Color:</th><td>\n								 Blue\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Compliancy:</th><td>\n								 RoHS\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Material:</th><td>\n								 Composite Polyester/Polyurethane\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Minimum Pulley Diameter:</th><td>\n								 3.00"", 80mm\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Special Feature:</th><td>\n								 Antistatic properties\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Top Width:</th><td>\n								 1/2"", 13mm\n							</td></tr>\n						\n				</table>\n			\n		\n</div>"

Also ideal for conveying applications designed for 3L section belts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PowerTwist Plus can&#39;t be outperformed!</strong> PowerTwist Plus sets the standard for link V-belt longevity and durability. Other brands don&#39;t come close. The combination of high strength and low elongation under load simply cannot be beaten. Because they&#39;re made of a custom-designed, high-tech polyurethane/polyester composite, PowerTwist Plus V-belts won&#39;t fail you when others may. The result? Less downtime. Higher productivity. Reduced maintenance costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Everyday industrial workhorse<br />\r\n&bull; Minimized maintenance time<br />\r\n&bull; High performance polyester/polyurethane composite technology with the same horsepower ratings as conventional rubber V-belts<br />\r\n&bull; Easy to inventory<br />\r\n&bull; Offer problem solving alternatives to V-belts of classical cross-sections<br />\r\n&bull; Drop-in permanent upgrade for conventional endless rubber V-belts</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The right belt at the right time!</strong> Instead of trying to carry all the endless V-belt sizes you might need, with PowerTwist Plus, you only need to stock the most common cross sections - 3L, 4L/A, 5L/B, C and D - and you&#39;ll have almost 100%, on-site availability guaranteed. With PowerTwist Plus you will reduce the inventory dollars you have tied up in replacement V-belts and still have instant availability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Perfectly suited to Z/10, 3L, A/13, B/17, C/22, and D/32 drives<br />\r\n&bull; Reduced inventory&hellip; any belt, any time!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>No tools required.</strong> No matter what equipment you are operating, productivity is critical. PowerTwist Plus V-Belts minimize downtime with no tools required, easy installation in minutes without machine tear-downs or struggling with rusted-down motor bases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PowerTwist Plus V-Belts have the same cross section dimensions as conventional endless V-belts and can be installed on existing pulleys with no changes in set-up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Single or matched V-belt sets can be made with a flick of the wrist! PowerTwist Plus V-Belts can be made up to required length by hand in seconds and rolled onto the drive just like a bicycle chain. Their custom multi-ply composite construction prevents roll-on damage. If conventional rubber V-belts are installed this way, almost certainly some of the load-bearing tension cords will be broken, leading to significantly reduced belt life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Easier, faster installation<br />\r\n&bull; Easily installed without dismantling drive components<br />\r\n&bull; Make any length by hand in seconds without any tools<br />\r\n&bull; Simplified drive design</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tame hostile environments</strong> If your V-belt drives are operating in hostile, nasty environments, you&#39;ve got to take advantage of the high performance properties of polyurethanes.

Also ideal for conveying applications that frequently have issues with static electricity, such as glass and solar cell manufacturing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Have an application where static electricity is getting you all charged up?</strong> Fenner Drives’ patented PowerTwist Plus Antistatic is the answer… with all the benefits of standard PowerTwist Plus along with the best antistatic properties of any V-belt on the market, easily passing the ISO 1813:1998 standard. While the standard allows the resistance of the drive belt to be as high as 3.6 mega ohms (3,600,000 ohms), PowerTwist Plus Antistatic typically registers well below 50 ohms, while even the best so called antistatic (static conductive) rubber belts usually measure between a shocking 10,000-200,000 ohms. Unlike antistatic rubber V-belts whose antistatic properties may be adversely affected by humidity levels, environmental conditions and wear, PowerTwist Plus Antistatic’s proprietary construction allows the belt’s antistatic properties to perform in the harshest conditions. PowerTwist Plus Antistatic is a drop-in replacement for classical section V-belts.</p>\n\n<p>• 100% ISO 1813:1998 inspected and certified by Fenner Drives<br>\n• Ultralow resistance antistatic V-belt<br>\n• Antistatic properties unaffected by humidity levels<br>\n• Electric Blue color for easy identification<br>\n• US Patents 7,621,114 and 7,950,213</p>\n\n<p><strong>PowerTwist Plus Antistatic can't be outperformed!</strong> PowerTwist Plus Antistatic sets the standard for link V-belt longevity and durability. Other brands don't come close. The combination of high strength and low elongation under load simply cannot be beaten. Because they're made of a custom-designed, high-tech polyurethane/polyester composite, PowerTwist Plus Antistatic V-belts won't fail you when others may. The result? Less downtime. Higher productivity. Reduced maintenance costs.</p>\n\n<p>• Antistatic industrial workhorse<br>\n• Minimized maintenance time<br>\n• High performance polyester/polyurethane composite technology with the same horsepower ratings as conventional rubber V-belts<br>\n• Easy to inventory<br>\n• Offer problem solving alternatives to V-belts of classical cross-sections<br>\n• Drop-in permanent upgrade for conventional endless rubber V-belts</p>\n\n<p><strong>The right belt at the right time!</strong> Instead of trying to carry all the endless V-belt sizes you might need, with PowerTwist Plus Antistatic, you only need to stock the most common cross sections - A/13/4L and B/17/5L and you'll have almost 100%, on-site availability guaranteed. With PowerTwist Plus Antistatic you will reduce the inventory dollars that you have tied up in replacement V-belts and still have instant availability.</p>\n\n<p>• Perfectly suited to A/13/4L, and B/17/5L drives<br>\n• Reduced inventory… any belt, any time!</p>\n\n<p><strong>No tools required.</strong> No matter what equipment you are operating, productivity is critical.

PowerTwist Plus Antistatic V-Belts can be made up to required length by hand in seconds and rolled onto the drive just like a bicycle chain. Their custom multi-ply composite construction prevents roll-on damage. If conventional rubber V-belts are installed this way, almost certainly some of the load-bearing tension cords will be broken, leading to significantly reduced belt life.</p>\n\n<p>• Easier, faster installation<br>\n• Easily installed without dismantling drive components<br>\n• Make any length by hand in seconds without any tools<br>\n• Simplified drive design</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tame hostile environments</strong> If your V-belt drives are operating in hostile, nasty environments, you've got to take advantage of the high performance properties of polyurethanes. That's why we use a high performance polyurethane elastomer reinforced with multiple plies of polyester fabric for PowerTwist Plus Antistatic. This custom material provides PowerTwist Plus Antistatic with significantly superior resistance to oils, grease, water, and the most common industrial/agricultural chemicals and solvents. Plus an operating temperature range, with no loss of performance, of -40º F to +240º F. Conventional SBR/chloroprene brand V-belts simply can't compete.</p>\n\n<p>If your drive environment is like hell's kitchen and conventional V-belt life is down to a few months, PowerTwist Plus Antistatic may be your long term answer.</p>\n\n<p>• Longer belt life in harsh operating conditions<br>\n• Unaffected by extreme temperatures, water, steam, oil, grease, and common industrial chemicals and solvents</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reduce transmitted vibration.</strong> All conventional V-belts with a continuous tensile cord will transmit vibrations from the motor to driveN components; these vibrations cause system noise and can significantly shorten bearing life. The segmented twist-lock design of PowerTwist Plus Antistatic acts as a vibration dampener - vibration can enter a link but cannot be transmitted as there is no continuous tension cord present.

817626;0418050SL;"<h5>Description</h5><p>Anytime, Anywhere, Anybelt™, B/17/5L section PowerTwist Plus V-Belts combine industry standard horsepower ratings, superior performance in challenging operating environments with fast, easy installation and are a permanent replacement upgrade from traditional rubber V-belts.</p><div>\n			\n                <p><strong>Best Suited For:</strong> Any power transmission application designed to use classical B/17/5L section industrial rubber V-belts. Also ideal for conveying applications designed for B/17/5L section belts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PowerTwist Plus can't be outperformed!</strong> PowerTwist Plus sets the standard for link V-belt longevity and durability. Other brands don't come close. The combination of high strength and low elongation under load simply cannot be beaten. Because they're made of a custom-designed, high-tech polyurethane/polyester composite, PowerTwist Plus V-belts won't fail you when others may. The result? Less downtime. Higher productivity. Reduced maintenance costs.</p>\n\n<p>• Everyday industrial workhorse<br>\n• Minimized maintenance time<br>\n• High performance polyester/polyurethane composite technology with the same horsepower ratings as conventional rubber V-belts<br>\n• Easy to inventory<br>\n• Offer problem solving alternatives to V-belts of classical cross-sections<br>\n• Drop-in permanent upgrade for conventional endless rubber V-belts</p>\n\n<p><strong>The right belt at the right time!</strong> Instead of trying to carry all the endless V-belt sizes you might need, with PowerTwist Plus, you only need to stock the most common cross sections - 3L, 4L/A, 5L/B, C and D - and you'll have almost 100%, on-site availability guaranteed. With PowerTwist Plus you will reduce the inventory dollars you have tied up in replacement V-belts and still have instant availability.</p>\n\n<p>• Perfectly suited to Z/10, 3L, A/13, B/17, C/22, and D/32 drives<br>\n• Reduced inventory… any belt, any time!</p>\n\n<p><strong>No tools required.</strong> No matter what equipment you are operating, productivity is critical. PowerTwist Plus V-Belts minimize downtime with no tools required, easy installation in minutes without machine tear-downs or struggling with rusted-down motor bases.</p>\n\n<p>PowerTwist Plus V-Belts have the same cross section dimensions as conventional endless V-belts and can be installed on existing pulleys with no changes in set-up.</p>\n\n<p>Single or matched V-belt sets can be made with a flick of the wrist! PowerTwist Plus V-Belts can be made up to required length by hand in seconds and rolled onto the drive just like a bicycle chain. Their custom multi-ply composite construction prevents roll-on damage. If conventional rubber V-belts are installed this way, almost certainly some of the load-bearing tension cords will be broken, leading to significantly reduced belt life.</p>\n\n<p>• Easier, faster installation<br>\n• Easily installed without dismantling drive components<br>\n• Make any length by hand in seconds without any tools<br>\n• Simplified drive design</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tame hostile environments</strong> If your V-belt drives are operating in hostile, nasty environments, you've got to take advantage of the high performance properties of polyurethanes. That's why we use a high performance polyurethane elastomer reinforced with multiple plies of polyester fabric for PowerTwist Plus. This custom material provides PowerTwist Plus with significantly superior resistance to oils, grease, water, most common industrial/agricultural chemicals and solvents. Plus an operating temperature range, with no loss of performance, of -40º F to +240º F. Conventional SBR/chloroprene brand V-belts simply can't compete.</p>\n\n<p>If your drive environment is like hell's kitchen and conventional V-belt life is down to a few months, PowerTwist Plus may be your long term answer.</p>\n\n<p>• Longer belt life in harsh operating conditions<br>\n• Unaffected by extreme temperatures, water, steam, oil, grease, and common industrial chemicals and solvents</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reduce transmitted vibration.</strong> All conventional V-belts with a continuous tensile cord will transmit vibrations from the motor to driven components; these vibrations cause system noise and can significantly shorten bearing life. The segmented twist-lock design of PowerTwist Plus acts as a vibration dampener - vibration can enter a link but cannot be transmitted as there is no continuous tension cord present. Save your bearings - fit PowerTwist Plus V-belts!</p>\n\n<p>• unique belt construction dampens transmitted motor vibrations, extending the bearing life and reducing noise levels<br>\n• high resistance to abrasion and shock loads<br>\n<br>\n<strong>RoHS 2002/95/EC Directive compliant.</strong></p>\n\n            \n		</div><h5>Specifications</h5><div>\n	\n			\n				\n				<table class=""description-table"">\n					\n							<tr>\n								<th>Profile shape:</th><td>\n								 Vee\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Profile size:</th><td>\n								 B/17/5L\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Color:</th><td>\n								 Red\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Compliancy:</th><td>\n								 REACH, RoHS\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Material:</th><td>\n								 Composite Polyester/Polyurethane\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Minimum Pulley Diameter:</th><td>\n								 125mm, 5.00""\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Top Width:</th><td>\n								 17mm, 5/8""\n							</td></tr>\n						\n				</table>\n			\n		\n</div>"

This extremely durable polyurethane surface is fused with the rest of the belt and will never delaminate.</p>\n\n<p>• 85A polyurethane composite polyester/polyurethane material<br>\n• Top surface cannot delaminate</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you dream of minimal downtime and fast maintenance?</strong> PowerTwist Friction Top makes your dreams a reality! The combination of high strength and low elongation under load simply cannot be beaten. Because they combine a custom-designed, high-tech polyurethane/polyester composite with an 85A polyurethane top layer engineered into each link, PowerTwist Friction Top V-belts won’t fail you when others may. PowerTwist Friction Top minimizes downtime with no tools required and has easy installation in minutes without conveyor tear downs. Like all of Fenner Drives’ HPC V-belts, PowerTwist Friction can be made to length with a flick of the wrist!

Also ideal for conveying applications designed for B/17/5L section belts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PowerTwist Plus can't be outperformed!</strong> PowerTwist Plus sets the standard for link V-belt longevity and durability. Other brands don't come close. The combination of high strength and low elongation under load simply cannot be beaten. Because they're made of a custom-designed, high-tech polyurethane/polyester composite, PowerTwist Plus V-belts won't fail you when others may. The result? Less downtime. Higher productivity. Reduced maintenance costs.</p>\n\n<p>• Everyday industrial workhorse<br>\n• Minimized maintenance time<br>\n• High performance polyester/polyurethane composite technology with the same horsepower ratings as conventional rubber V-belts<br>\n• Easy to inventory<br>\n• Offer problem solving alternatives to V-belts of classical cross-sections<br>\n• Drop-in permanent upgrade for conventional endless rubber V-belts</p>\n\n<p><strong>The right belt at the right time!</strong> Instead of trying to carry all the endless V-belt sizes you might need, with PowerTwist Plus, you only need to stock the most common cross sections - 3L, 4L/A, 5L/B, C and D - and you'll have almost 100%, on-site availability guaranteed. With PowerTwist Plus you will reduce the inventory dollars you have tied up in replacement V-belts and still have instant availability.</p>\n\n<p>• Perfectly suited to Z/10, 3L, A/13, B/17, C/22, and D/32 drives<br>\n• Reduced inventory… any belt, any time!</p>\n\n<p><strong>No tools required.</strong> No matter what equipment you are operating, productivity is critical. PowerTwist Plus V-Belts minimize downtime with no tools required, easy installation in minutes without machine tear-downs or struggling with rusted-down motor bases.</p>\n\n<p>PowerTwist Plus V-Belts have the same cross section dimensions as conventional endless V-belts and can be installed on existing pulleys with no changes in set-up.</p>\n\n<p>Single or matched V-belt sets can be made with a flick of the wrist! PowerTwist Plus V-Belts can be made up to required length by hand in seconds and rolled onto the drive just like a bicycle chain. Their custom multi-ply composite construction prevents roll-on damage. If conventional rubber V-belts are installed this way, almost certainly some of the load-bearing tension cords will be broken, leading to significantly reduced belt life.</p>\n\n<p>• Easier, faster installation<br>\n• Easily installed without dismantling drive components<br>\n• Make any length by hand in seconds without any tools<br>\n• Simplified drive design</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tame hostile environments</strong> If your V-belt drives are operating in hostile, nasty environments, you've got to take advantage of the high performance properties of polyurethanes. That's why we use a high performance polyurethane elastomer reinforced with multiple plies of polyester fabric for PowerTwist Plus. This custom material provides PowerTwist Plus with significantly superior resistance to oils, grease, water, most common industrial/agricultural chemicals and solvents. Plus an operating temperature range, with no loss of performance, of -40º F to +240º F.

Other brands don't come close. The combination of high strength and low elongation under load simply cannot be beaten. Because they're made of a custom-designed, high-tech polyurethane/polyester composite, PowerTwist Plus V-belts won't fail you when others may. The result? Less downtime. Higher productivity. Reduced maintenance costs.</p>\n\n<p>• Everyday industrial workhorse<br>\n• Minimized maintenance time<br>\n• High performance polyester/polyurethane composite technology with the same horsepower ratings as conventional rubber V-belts<br>\n• Easy to inventory<br>\n• Offer problem solving alternatives to V-belts of classical cross-sections<br>\n• Drop-in permanent upgrade for conventional endless rubber V-belts</p>\n\n<p><strong>The right belt at the right time!</strong> Instead of trying to carry all the endless V-belt sizes you might need, with PowerTwist Plus, you only need to stock the most common cross sections - 3L, 4L/A, 5L/B, C and D - and you'll have almost 100%, on-site availability guaranteed. With PowerTwist Plus you will reduce the inventory dollars you have tied up in replacement V-belts and still have instant availability.</p>\n\n<p>• Perfectly suited to Z/10, 3L, A/13, B/17, C/22, and D/32 drives<br>\n• Reduced inventory… any belt, any time!</p>\n\n<p><strong>No tools required.</strong> No matter what equipment you are operating, productivity is critical.

PowerTwist Plus V-Belts can be made up to required length by hand in seconds and rolled onto the drive just like a bicycle chain. Their custom multi-ply composite construction prevents roll-on damage. If conventional rubber V-belts are installed this way, almost certainly some of the load-bearing tension cords will be broken, leading to significantly reduced belt life.</p>\n\n<p>• Easier, faster installation<br>\n• Easily installed without dismantling drive components<br>\n• Make any length by hand in seconds without any tools<br>\n• Simplified drive design</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tame hostile environments</strong> If your V-belt drives are operating in hostile, nasty environments, you've got to take advantage of the high performance properties of polyurethanes. That's why we use a high performance polyurethane elastomer reinforced with multiple plies of polyester fabric for PowerTwist Plus. This custom material provides PowerTwist Plus with significantly superior resistance to oils, grease, water, most common industrial/agricultural chemicals and solvents. Plus an operating temperature range, with no loss of performance, of -40º F to +240º F. Conventional SBR/chloroprene brand V-belts simply can't compete.</p>\n\n<p>If your drive environment is like hell's kitchen and conventional V-belt life is down to a few months, PowerTwist Plus may be your long term answer.</p>\n\n<p>• Longer belt life in harsh operating conditions<br>\n• Unaffected by extreme temperatures, water, steam, oil, grease, and common industrial chemicals and solvents</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reduce transmitted vibration.</strong> All conventional V-belts with a continuous tensile cord will transmit vibrations from the motor to driven components; these vibrations cause system noise and can significantly shorten bearing life.

155133;0408250;"<h5>Description</h5><p>BB Section PowerTwist Double-V V-Belt is a permanent drop-in replacement for traditional double-V rubber belts in serpentine drives, where power needs to be transmitted by both sides of the belt.  PowerTwist Double-V V-Belts also transmit high power while exhibiting low stretch.  Also has a fast and easy installation process.</p><div>\n			\n                <p><strong>Best Suited For:</strong> Ideal for use with serpentine drives or for use in conveying applications where a lower contact area between the belt and the conveyed item is desired.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>The same great benefits!</strong> PowerTwist Double-V V-Belt is a derivative of our famous PowerTwist Plus V-Belts which means that you will get all the same benefits! The combination of high strength and low elongation under load simply cannot be beaten. Because they're made of a custom-designed, high-tech polyurethane/polyester composite, PowerTwist Double-V V-belts won't fail you when others may. The result? Less downtime. Higher productivity. Reduced maintenance costs.<br>\n<br>\n• Everyday industrial workhorse<br>\n• Minimized maintenance time<br>\n• High performance polyester/polyurethane composite technology<br>\n• Easy to inventory</p>\n\n<p><strong>The right belt at the right time!</strong> Instead of trying to carry all the endless V-belt sizes you might need, with PowerTwist Double-V, you only need to stock AA, BB, and CC cross sections and you will have almost 100% on site availability guaranteed. With PowerTwist Double-V V-Belt you will reduce the inventory dollars that you have tied up in replacement V-belts and still have instant availability.<br>\n<br>\n• Perfectly suited for AA, BB, and CC drives<br>\n• Reduced inventory… any belt, any time!</p>\n\n<p><strong>No tools required.</strong> No matter what equipment you are operating, productivity is critical. PowerTwist Double-V V-Belts minimize downtime with no tools required and has easy installation in minutes without machine tear-downs or struggling with rusted-down motor bases.<br>\nSingle or matched V-belt sets can be made with a flick of the wrist! PowerTwist Double-V V-Belts can be made up to required length by hand in seconds and rolled onto the drive just like a bicycle chain. Their custom multi-ply composite construction prevents roll-on damage. If conventional rubber double V V-belts are installed this way, almost certainly some of the load-bearing tension cords will be broken, leading to significantly reduced belt life.</p>\n\n<p>• Easier, faster installation<br>\n• Easily installed without dismantling drive components<br>\n• Make any length by hand in seconds without any tools<br>\n• Simplified drive design</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tame hostile environments</strong> If your V-belt drives are operating in hostile, nasty environments, you've got to take advantage of the high performance properties of polyurethanes. That's why we use a high performance polyurethane elastomer reinforced with multiple plies of polyester fabric for PowerTwist Double-V. This custom material provides PowerTwist Double-V with significantly superior resistance to oils, grease, water, and the most common industrial/agricultural chemicals and solvents. Plus an operating temperature range, with no loss of performance, of -40º F to +240º F. Conventional SBR/chloroprene brand V-belts simply can't compete.</p>\n\n<p>If your drive environment is like hell's kitchen and conventional V-belt life is down to a few months, PowerTwist Double-V may be your long term answer.</p>\n\n<p>• Longer belt life in harsh operating conditions<br>\n• Unaffected by extreme temperatures, water, steam, oil, grease, and common industrial chemicals and solvents</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reduce transmitted vibration.</strong> All conventional V-belts with a continuous internal mono tension cord will transmit vibrations from the motor to driveN components; these vibrations cause system noise and can significantly shorten bearing life. The segmented twist-lock design of PowerTwist Double-V acts as a vibration dampener - vibration can enter a link but cannot be transmitted as there is no continuous tension cord present. Save your bearings - fit PowerTwist Double-V V-belts!</p>\n\n<p>• unique belt construction dampens transmitted motor vibrations, extending the bearing life and reducing noise levels<br>\n• high resistance to abrasion and shock loads<br>\n<br>\n<strong>RoHS 2002/95/EC Directive compliant.</strong></p>\n\n            \n		</div><h5>Specifications</h5><div>\n	\n			\n				\n				<table class=""description-table"">\n					\n							<tr>\n								<th>Profile shape:</th><td>\n								 Double Vee\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Profile size:</th><td>\n								 BB\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Color:</th><td>\n								 Red\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Compliancy:</th><td>\n								 RoHS\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Material:</th><td>\n								 Composite Polyester/Polyurethane\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Minimum Pulley Diameter:</th><td>\n								 125mm, 5.00""\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Special Feature:</th><td>\n								 Vee profile on both side\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Top Width:</th><td>\n								 17mm, 5/8""\n							</td></tr>\n						\n				</table>\n			\n		\n</div>"

Also ideal for conveying applications designed for D/32 section belts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PowerTwist Plus can't be outperformed!</strong> PowerTwist Plus sets the standard for link V-belt longevity and durability. Other brands don't come close. The combination of high strength and low elongation under load simply cannot be beaten. Because they're made of a custom-designed, high-tech polyurethane/polyester composite, PowerTwist Plus V-belts won't fail you when others may. The result? Less downtime. Higher productivity. Reduced maintenance costs.</p>\n\n<p>• Everyday industrial workhorse<br>\n• Minimized maintenance time<br>\n• High performance polyester/polyurethane composite technology with the same horsepower ratings as conventional rubber V-belts<br>\n• Easy to inventory<br>\n• Offer problem solving alternatives to V-belts of classical cross-sections<br>\n• Drop-in permanent upgrade for conventional endless rubber V-belts</p>\n\n<p><strong>The right belt at the right time!</strong> Instead of trying to carry all the endless V-belt sizes you might need, with PowerTwist Plus, you only need to stock the most common cross sections - 3L, 4L/A, 5L/B, C and D - and you'll have almost 100%, on-site availability guaranteed. With PowerTwist Plus you will reduce the inventory dollars you have tied up in replacement V-belts and still have instant availability.</p>\n\n<p>• Perfectly suited to Z/10, 3L, A/13, B/17, C/22, and D/32 drives<br>\n• Reduced inventory… any belt, any time!</p>\n\n<p><strong>No tools required.</strong> No matter what equipment you are operating, productivity is critical. PowerTwist Plus V-Belts minimize downtime with no tools required, easy installation in minutes without machine tear-downs or struggling with rusted-down motor bases.</p>\n\n<p>PowerTwist Plus V-Belts have the same cross section dimensions as conventional endless V-belts and can be installed on existing pulleys with no changes in set-up.</p>\n\n<p>Single or matched V-belt sets can be made with a flick of the wrist! PowerTwist Plus V-Belts can be made up to required length by hand in seconds and rolled onto the drive just like a bicycle chain. Their custom multi-ply composite construction prevents roll-on damage. If conventional rubber V-belts are installed this way, almost certainly some of the load-bearing tension cords will be broken, leading to significantly reduced belt life.</p>\n\n<p>• Easier, faster installation<br>\n• Easily installed without dismantling drive components<br>\n• Make any length by hand in seconds without any tools<br>\n• Simplified drive design</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tame hostile environments</strong> If your V-belt drives are operating in hostile, nasty environments, you've got to take advantage of the high performance properties of polyurethanes. That's why we use a high performance polyurethane elastomer reinforced with multiple plies of polyester fabric for PowerTwist Plus. This custom material provides PowerTwist Plus with significantly superior resistance to oils, grease, water, most common industrial/agricultural chemicals and solvents. Plus an operating temperature range, with no loss of performance, of -40º F to +240º F. Conventional SBR/chloroprene brand V-belts simply can't compete.</p>\n\n<p>If your drive environment is like hell's kitchen and conventional V-belt life is down to a few months, PowerTwist Plus may be your long term answer.</p>\n\n<p>• Longer belt life in harsh operating conditions<br>\n• Unaffected by extreme temperatures, water, steam, oil, grease, and common industrial chemicals and solvents</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reduce transmitted vibration.</strong> All conventional V-belts with a continuous tensile cord will transmit vibrations from the motor to driven components; these vibrations cause system noise and can significantly shorten bearing life. The segmented twist-lock design of PowerTwist Plus acts as a vibration dampener - vibration can enter a link but cannot be transmitted as there is no continuous tension cord present. Save your bearings - fit PowerTwist Plus V-belts!</p>\n\n<p>• unique belt construction dampens transmitted motor vibrations, extending the bearing life and reducing noise levels<br>\n• high resistance to abrasion and shock loads<br>\n<br>\n<strong>RoHS 2002/95/EC Directive compliant.</strong></p>\n\n            \n		</div><h5>Specifications</h5><div>\n	\n			\n				\n				<table class=""description-table"">\n					\n							<tr>\n								<th>Profile shape:</th><td>\n								 Vee\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Profile size:</th><td>\n								 D/32\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Color:</th><td>\n								 Red\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Compliancy:</th><td>\n								 RoHS\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Material:</th><td>\n								 Composite Polyester/Polyurethane\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Minimum Pulley Diameter:</th><td>\n								 13.2"", 335mm\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Top Width:</th><td>\n								 1 1/4"", 32mm\n							</td></tr>\n						\n				</table>\n			\n		\n</div>"

All Trantorque units use a single hex nut for speed and simplicity of installation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&bull; Designed with external counter-torque flange<br />\r\n&bull; Exceptional concentricity and ability to accommodate bending loads<br />\r\n&bull; Limited axial movement during installation<br />\r\n&bull; All Trantorque units use a single hex nut for speed and simplicity of installation<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Features of Fenner Drives Keyless Bushings:</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\n&bull; Ability to transmit higher torques than keyed connections<br />\r\n&bull; True zero-backlash<br />\r\n&bull; Less equipment downtime<br />\r\n&bull; Ability to mount over existing keyways<br />\r\n&bull; Complete axial and radial adjustability<br />\r\n&bull; Simple installation, adjustment and removal<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll Fenner Drives keyless locking devices operate using the simple wedge principle. An axial force is applied- by either a hex nut (Trantorque) or a series of annular screws (B-LOC)- to engage circular steel rings with mating tapers. The resulting wedge action creates a radial force on the tapered rings, one of which contracts to squeeze the shaft while the other expands and presses into the component bore.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h5>Specifications</h5>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<table class=""description-table"">\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>Series:</th>\r\n			<td>Trantorque GT</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>Torque Transmission:</th>\r\n			<td>365 ft lb</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>Axial Movement:</th>\r\n			<td>Approximately 0.075&quot;</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>Compliancy:</th>\r\n			<td>RoHS</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>Component Bore Diameter:</th>\r\n			<td>2&quot;</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>Hub Pressure:</th>\r\n			<td>8313 psi</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>Installation Torque:</th>\r\n			<td>167 ft lb</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>Internal/ External:</th>\r\n			<td>Internal</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>Material:</th>\r\n			<td>Steel</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>Metric/Inch:</th>\r\n			<td>Inch</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>Releasing/ Locking:</th>\r\n			<td>Locking</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>Self-Centering:</th>\r\n			<td>Yes</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>Shaft Diameter:</th>\r\n			<td>1 1/4&quot;</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>Taper:</th>\r\n			<td>Single</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>Thrust:</th>\r\n			<td>7014 lbs</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>"

While the standard allows the resistance of the drive belt to be as high as 3.6 mega ohms (3,600,000 ohms), PowerTwist Plus Antistatic typically registers well below 50 ohms, while even the best so called antistatic (static conductive) rubber belts usually measure between a shocking 10,000-200,000 ohms. Unlike antistatic rubber V-belts whose antistatic properties may be adversely affected by humidity levels, environmental conditions and wear, PowerTwist Plus Antistatic’s proprietary construction allows the belt’s antistatic properties to perform in the harshest conditions.

Since the B-LOC B400 Series Keyless Bushings do not have a flange, the external diameter along the unit’s entire length is the same, therefore allowing the unit to be completely inserted into the component bore for flushed or recessed mounting. <br><br>• Self-releasing double taper design permits simple adjustment and removal<br>• No axial movement during installation<br>• Recessed installation without the need for a counterbore<br><br>Note: This product is not self-centering but Fenner Drives offers pilot bushings that provide pre-centering when required. The pilot bushings are supplied in sets of three (3) bushings and three (3) longer screws (replace plated locking screws).<br><br><strong>Features of Fenner Drives Keyless Bushings:</strong><br><br>• Ability to transmit higher torques<br>• True zero-backlash<br>• Less equipment downtime<br>• Ability to mount over existing keyways<br>• Complete axial and radial adjustability<br>• Simple installation, adjustment and removal<br><br>All Fenner Drives keyless locking devices operate using the simple wedge principle. An axial force is applied- by either a hex nut (Trantorque) or a series of annular screws (B-LOC)- to engage circular steel rings with mating tapers. The resulting wedge action creates a radial force on the tapered rings, one of which contracts to squeeze the shaft while the other expands and presses into the component bore.</p>\n            \n		</div><h5>Specifications</h5><div>\n	\n			\n				\n				<table class=""description-table"">\n					\n							<tr>\n								<th>Series:</th><td>\n								 B400\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Torque Transmission:</th><td>\n								 9471\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Axial Movement:</th><td>\n								 No\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Bore Tolerance:</th><td>\n								 5.713\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Component Bore Diameter:</th><td>\n								 5.709""\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Hub Pressure:</th><td>\n								 26204\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Installation Torque:</th><td>\n								 91 ft lb\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Internal/ External:</th><td>\n								 Internal\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Material:</th><td>\n								 Steel\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Metric/Inch:</th><td>\n								 Inch\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Releasing/ Locking:</th><td>\n								 Releasing\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Screw Size:</th><td>\n								 M12 x 30\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Self-Centering:</th><td>\n								 No\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Shaft Diameter:</th><td>\n								 3 15/16""\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Shaft Tolerance:</th><td>\n								 3.9335\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Taper:</th><td>\n								 Double\n							</td></tr>\n						\n							<tr>\n								<th>Thrust:</th><td>\n								 57726\n							</td></tr>\n						\n				</table>\n			\n		\n</div>"

PowerTwist Double-V V-Belts also transmit high power while exhibiting low stretch.  Also has a fast and easy installation process.</p><div>\n			\n                <p><strong>Best Suited For:</strong> Ideal for use with serpentine drives or for use in conveying applications where a lower contact area between the belt and the conveyed item is desired.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>The same great benefits!</strong> PowerTwist Double-V V-Belt is a derivative of our famous PowerTwist Plus V-Belts which means that you will get all the same benefits! The combination of high strength and low elongation under load simply cannot be beaten. Because they're made of a custom-designed, high-tech polyurethane/polyester composite, PowerTwist Double-V V-belts won't fail you when others may. The result? Less downtime. Higher productivity. Reduced maintenance costs.<br>\n<br>\n• Everyday industrial workhorse<br>\n• Minimized maintenance time<br>\n• High performance polyester/polyurethane composite technology<br>\n• Easy to inventory</p>\n\n<p><strong>The right belt at the right time!</strong> Instead of trying to carry all the endless V-belt sizes you might need, with PowerTwist Double-V, you only need to stock AA, BB, and CC cross sections and you will have almost 100% on site availability guaranteed. With PowerTwist Double-V V-Belt you will reduce the inventory dollars that you have tied up in replacement V-belts and still have instant availability.<br>\n<br>\n• Perfectly suited for AA, BB, and CC drives<br>\n• Reduced inventory… any belt, any time!</p>\n\n<p><strong>No tools required.</strong> No matter what equipment you are operating, productivity is critical.

There is no axial movement during installation. The B-LOC B112 Series eliminates the need to hold the shaft or lock machine while applying installation torque, making for fast and easy component repositioning. Since the B-LOC B112 Series Keyless Bushings do not have a flange, the external diameter along the unit’s entire length is the same, therefore allowing the unit to be completely inserted into the component bore for flushed or recessed mounting.

With PowerTwist Plus you will reduce the inventory dollars you have tied up in replacement V-belts and still have instant availability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Perfectly suited to Z/10, 3L, A/13, B/17, C/22, and D/32 drives<br />\r\n&bull; Reduced inventory&hellip; any belt, any time!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>No tools required.</strong> No matter what equipment you are operating, productivity is critical.

PowerTwist Plus V-Belts can be made up to required length by hand in seconds and rolled onto the drive just like a bicycle chain. Their custom multi-ply composite construction prevents roll-on damage. If conventional rubber V-belts are installed this way, almost certainly some of the load-bearing tension cords will be broken, leading to significantly reduced belt life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Easier, faster installation<br />\r\n&bull; Easily installed without dismantling drive components<br />\r\n&bull; Make any length by hand in seconds without any tools<br />\r\n&bull; Simplified drive design</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tame hostile environments</strong> If your V-belt drives are operating in hostile, nasty environments, you&#39;ve got to take advantage of the high performance properties of polyurethanes. That&#39;s why we use a high performance polyurethane elastomer reinforced with multiple plies of polyester fabric for PowerTwist Plus. This custom material provides PowerTwist Plus with significantly superior resistance to oils, grease, water, most common industrial/agricultural chemicals and solvents. Plus an operating temperature range, with no loss of performance, of -40&ordm; F to +240&ordm; F. Conventional SBR/chloroprene brand V-belts simply can&#39;t compete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your drive environment is like hell&#39;s kitchen and conventional V-belt life is down to a few months, PowerTwist Plus may be your long term answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Longer belt life in harsh operating conditions<br />\r\n&bull; Unaffected by extreme temperatures, water, steam, oil, grease, and common industrial chemicals and solvents</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reduce transmitted vibration.</strong> All conventional V-belts with a continuous tensile cord will transmit vibrations from the motor to driven components; these vibrations cause system noise and can significantly shorten bearing life. The segmented twist-lock design of PowerTwist Plus acts as a vibration dampener - vibration can enter a link but cannot be transmitted as there is no continuous tension cord present.
